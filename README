==============

Remix of honk-benjojo, further remix of honk.

honk-benjojo changes:

0) / is a file server, rather than honk, access by /honk
 (You can co-exist with your static site!)
1) Avatar support
2) Twitter-like styles, less purple
3) Source code has functions I've tried to understand renamed
4) MP4 support
5) GIF support
6) Twitter imports work again
7) -display.days to show you how deep a timeline should go (I set to 90)
8) Likes are syslogged, but still not displayed on the WebUI, or stored

honk

-- features

Take control of your honks and join the federation.
An ActivityPub server with minimal setup and support costs.
Spend more time using the software and less time operating it.

No attention mining.
No likes, no faves, no polls, no stars, no claps, no counts.

-- build

Go, libsqlite3-dev.

make

-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database. This will ask four questions.
./honk init
username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: localhost:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.
./honk

-- upgrade

./honk-backup `date +backup-%F`
./honk upgrade
./honk
